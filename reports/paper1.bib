   abstract = {A dynamic server migration and consolidation algorithm is introduced. The algorithm is shown to provide substantial improvement over static server consolidation in reducing the amount of required capacity and the rate of service level agreement violations. Benefits accrue for workloads that are variable and can be forecast over intervals shorter than the time scale of demand variability. The management algorithm reduces the amount of physical capacity required to support a specified rate of SLA violations for a given workload by as much as 50% as compared to static consolidation approach. Another result is that the rate of SLA violations at fixed capacity may be reduced by up to 20%. The results are based on hundreds of production workload traces across a variety of operating systems, applications, and industries.},

   abstract = {Cloud computing is a recent advancement wherein IT infrastructure and applications are provided as a services  to end-users under a usage-based payment model. It can leverage virtualized services even on the fly based on requirements (workload patterns and QoS) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and application provisioning environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of VMs under inter-networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as HP Labs in U.S.A., are using CloudSim in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy-efficient management of data center resources. The usefulness of CloudSim is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model significantly improves the application QoS requirements under fluctuating resource and service demand patterns.

   abstract = {Commodity clusters are used routinely for deploying service hosting platforms. Due to hardware and operation costs, clusters need to be shared among multiple services. Crucial for enabling such shared hosting platforms is virtual machine (VM) technology, which allows consolidation of hardware resources. A key challenge, however, is to make appropriate decisions when allocating hardware resources to service instances. In this work we propose a formulation of the resource allocation problem in shared hosting platforms for static workloads with servers that provide multiple types of resources. Our formulation supports a mix of best-effort and QoS scenarios, and, via a precisely defined objective function, promotes performance, fairness, and cluster utilization. Further, this formulation makes it possible to compute a bound on the optimal resource allocation. We propose several classes of resource allocation algorithms, which we evaluate in simulation. We are able to identify an algorithm that achieves average performance close to the optimal across many experimental scenarios. Furthermore, this algorithm runs in only a few seconds for large platforms and thus is usable in practice.},

   abstract = {Workload placement on servers has been traditionally driven by mainly performance objectives. In this work, we investigate the design, implementation, and evaluation of a power-aware application placement controller in the context of an environment with heterogeneous virtualized server clusters. The placement component of the application management middleware takes into account the power and migration costs in addition to the performance benefit while placing the application containers on the physical servers. The contribution of this work is two-fold: first, we present multiple ways to capture the cost-aware application placement problem that may be applied to various settings. For each formulation, we provide details on the kind of information required to solve the problems, the model assumptions, and the practicality of the assumptions on real servers. In the second part of our study, we present the pMapper architecture and placement algorithms to solve one practical formulation of the problem: minimizing power subject to a fixed performance requirement. We present comprehensive theoretical and experimental evidence to establish the efficacy of pMapper.},

  	abstract = {Server consolidation has emerged as a promising technique to reduce the energy costs of a data center. In this work, we present the first detailed analysis of an enterprise server workload from the perspective of finding characteristics for consolidation. We observe significant potential for power savings if consolidation is performed using off-peak values for application demand. However, these savings come up with associated risks due to consolidation, particularly when the correlation between applications is not considered. We also investigate the stability in utilization trends for low-risk consolidation. Using the insights from the workload analysis, two new consolidation methods are designed that achieve significant power savings, while containing the performance risk of consolidation. We present an implementation of the methodologies in a consolidation planning tool and provide a comprehensive evaluation study of the proposed methodologies.},

We present Sandpiper, a system that automates the task of monitoring and detecting hotspots, determining a new mapping of physical to virtual resources, resizing virtual machines to their new allocations, and initiating any necessary migrations. Sandpiper implements a black-box approach that is fully OS- and application-agnostic and a gray-box approach that exploits OS- and application-level statistics. We implement our techniques in Xen and conduct a detailed evaluation using a mix of CPU, network and memory-intensive applications. Our results show that Sandpiper is able to resolve single server hotspots within 20s and scales well to larger, data center environments. We also show that the gray-box approach can help Sandpiper make more informed decisions, particularly in response to memory pressure.},

While the methodologies may seem fine on the surface, certain drawbacks and anomalies can be uncovered when they are analyzed deeper. We point out those anomalies and draw backs in the existing literature and explain what are the root causes of such anomalies. Then we propose a novel methodology based on vector arithmetic which not only addresses those anomalies but also leads to some interesting theories and algorithms to tackle the above mentioned three functionalities required in managing resources of data centers. We believe that with a strong mathematical base, our methodology has the potential to become the foundation of future models and algorithms in this research area.},
