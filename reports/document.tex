\begin{abstract}
Virtual machine placement algorithms are the key issue for the energy-efficient
resource management in the data center environment. The placement problem is
often modeled as bin packing problem. Due to the NP hard nature of the problem,
there are only heuristic solutions, among which First Fit and Best Fit
algorithms have been used widely and have generally good results. However, their
simplicity leaves room to be further improved. In this paper we propose an
algorithm based on the simulated annealing theory, which enables continuous
improvement from any feasible state. Experiment results show that this
algorithm can generate better results, saving 0-25 percentage more energy than
FFD in an acceptable time amount.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Energy saving in data centers has become an increasingly urgent problem when
they have been growing larger and larger, consuming tremendous amount of
electricity. It is quoted in \cite{judge08} that the capacity demand of data
centers has been increasing by 12 percentages annually with the electricity prices
increasing by 4.4 percentages per year, and the electricity cost in data centers
in USA is estimated at \$3.3 billion in 2008. Virtualization technology like
VmWare\cite{vmware01} and Xen\cite{xen01}, which consolidate multiple logic
servers into smaller number of Physical Machines has been used to make better use of hardware and
save energy. Instead of having its own dedicated physical host, each logic
server runs on the Virtual Machine (VM) hosted on the Physical Machine (PM).
Besides the static consolidation, live VM migration technique has also been
applied to further reduce energy consumption by migrating VMs to fewer physical
nodes when workloads are lighter.

In both static and dynamic assignment of the VMs to the PMs, the algorithms of
assigning the VMs to the PMs are the key issue, which may affect the optimized
objective like energy conservation significantly by different placement
decisions. Ideally, there is a complete solution, which provides the best result
of the optimized objective. However, this is NP hard problem which has $M^{N}$
ways of placement, where N is the physical node number and M the virtual machine
number. Therefore, heuristic solutions are usually used to solve this type of
problem, as shown in the literature
\cite{verma08}\cite{verma09}\cite{wood09}\cite{kusic09}\cite{stillwell10}\cite{yao80}.

 First Fit Decreasing (FFD), Best Fit (BF) for Bin Packing problems are the
 well known types of them. In FFD algorithm, the balls are sorted by size in the
 descending order - largest first. The balls are then packed in the first
 available bin that can accommodate them. The bins are also ordered based on
 their efficiency, with the most efficient one in the head of the list. They
 have low complexity, good scalability and generally good results in
 practice\cite{yao80}. However, their main drawback is the over simplicity that
 overlooks the large amount of combinatory possibility that may have significantly better
 result. Furthermore, it only sorts the bins in one dimension; this will reduce
 their performance when the characteristics of other dimensions disrupt the
 ordering and undermine the fundamental optimization logic.
 
Best Fit has the poor performance in providing an overall placement, because it
only aims to find the best placement for the current VM. This local optimization
strategy makes it perform poorly in the global VM assignment in the clusters.
However it has been used often in dynamic placement when only one or several VMs
need to be adjusted like in the works \cite{calheiros11}\cite{beloglazov10}.

Genetic algorithms have the potential to take into account several dimensions in
its fitness function, and are believed to be able to generate a promising result
after a certain number of generations, but there have not been very successful
attempts in tackling the VM machine placement problem so far to our best
knowledge.

In this paper, we propose the Simulated Annealing Virtual Machine Placement(SAVMP)
algorithm; based on simulated annealing theory to solve this problem.
Simulated Annealing (SA); was proposed by Kirkpatrick et al\cite{kirkpatrick83}
to be a general framework of heuristic solutions to NP complete optimization problems.
The theory is based on the insightful analysis of connection between statistical
mechanics and multivariate or combinatorial optimization. The effectiveness of
SA comes from its extension of two basic heuristic techniques: 1) divide and
conquer approach; 2) iterative improvement scheme. It separates large changes
and small changes by allowing large changes in the objective function at high
temperatures while deferring small changes to low temperatures. It iteratively
moves the configuration by small steps from one state to another while
preventing from being stuck by allowing large changes at high temperatures.

To evaluate the performance of SAVMP, we compare the test results of it with
those of First Fit Decreasing and a random searching approach. Experiment results show that SAVMP has the better
performance at the cost of more time than FFD, outperforming FFD with 0-25
percentage more energy saving; SAVMP is also better than the random searching, which only performs well in small sized problems.

\section{Related Work}

Many researchers have proposed solutions to increase the energy efficiency of
the physical machines based on virtual machine technologies in data centers
\cite{verma08}\cite{verma09}\cite{wood09}\cite{kusic09}\cite{stillwell10}. 
Most of them make use of the ordering algorithm to generate a VM
placement. However, due to the non-trivial live VM migration cost, the First
Fit Decreasing (FFD) is not suitable to be used to re-map all the VMs to PMs every time interval.
For example, `pMapper' uses FFD to generate an initial assignment of VMs and later re-assign
VMs picked from PMs which violate resource constraints using Best Fit
\cite{verma08}; in MFR algorithm\cite{Bobroff07}, the prediction techniques are applied to deal
with variable demand proactively and FFD is applied according to the predicted
demand ; Sandpiper introduces `grey box', `black box' technique
to solve the hot spot in clusters \cite{wood09}. Our work differs from theirs in that they use the FFD as
the basic algorithm to come up solutions to meet resource requirement of the dynamic VM
workloads while conserving energy, but we are proposing an algorithm potential
to replace FFD or combine with FFD to generate a better VM placement.

Mishira et al\cite{mashira11} point out the `anomalies' in some existing VM packing algorithms,
after observing some abnormal placement results by the
algorithms . They propose a vector based approach in order to
make use of different resources of PMs in a more proportional way. In comparison, our proposed approach aims at
optimization of the objective function rather than achieving the balanced usage
of different resources directly, although the results found by our methodology should be
able to use the resources in a reasonably balanced way, otherwise it would lead
to higher energy cost.

Besides the ordering placement algorithms, Constraint Programming (CP) , a
software technology for solving combinatorial problems especially in areas of
planning and scheduling \cite{nakada09}, is also used to allocate resources on
PMs to VMs.
Entropy\cite{hermenier09}, for example, formulates the VM resource allocation
problem firstly as a constraint satisfaction problem then solve it by a
constraint solver to get the optimization solution in a homogeneous PM
environment. In the first step of Entropy, it finds the minimum number of PMs,
and searches for a `best' migration configuration to the new state in the second
step.
Although CP is a complete method, it is used by Entropy in a heuristic way
because it probably cannot finish searching in the limited time. It has a
certain similarity to our proposed approach in that it can stop the searching at
any time and use the best result achieved so far. However, the main limitation
of Entropy lies in the assumption that all the PMs should be identical.


Genetic Algorithm has been used widely as an effective heuristic way of solving
NP hard problems. It has also been applied in the VM placement problem
\cite{nakada09}\cite{campegiani09}.
However, in the published literature, there has not been much work in which it
performs very well in the resource allocation problem. Campegiani et
al\cite{campegiani09} only used a small number of VMs and PMs in evaluation of their GA based solution ,
and Nakada et al\cite{nakada09} did not use data to explain how well their
algorithm performed in their test environment. Therefore we cannot compare our proposed approach
with GA due to the lack of detail data about the GA application in the VM
placement problem.

Finally, SA is mentioned in Hser et al's work\cite{hyser07} in which they designed a modified
Simulation Annealing solver to allocate VMs among PMs, but they did not provide
detail information about their SA based methodology .

\section{Problem Formulation}
To formulate this problem we are dealing with in the mathematical form, let's
define\\
$N$ number of virtual machines\\
$M$	number of physical machines\\
$v_i$	the number $i$ virtual machine\\
$p_j$	the number $j$ phsical machine\\
$vp_{ij}$	the binary value representing whether virtual machine $v_i$ is
assigned to physical node $p_j$\\
$V$	the set of $N$ virtual machines, namely ${v_1,v_2,...,v_N}$\\
$P$	the set of M physical machines, namely ${p_1,p_2,...,p_M}$\\
$u_j$	the percentage of CPU utilization of $p_j$\\
$e_j$	the energy consumption of $p_j$\\
$e_{max}^j$	the energy consumption of $p_j$ when $u_j$=100\%\\
$e_{idle}^j$	the energy consumption of $p_j$ when $u_j$=0\%\\
$v_{cpu}^i$	the CPU demand of $v_i$\\
$v_{mem}^i$ the RAM demand of $v_i$\\
$v_{net}^i$	the Network Bandwidth capacity of $v_i$\\
$p_{cpu}^j$	 the CPU capacity of  $p_j$\\
$p_{mem}^j$ the RAM capacity of  $p_j$\\
$p_{net}^i$	the Network Bandwidth capacity of $p_j$\\
$VP$	the assignment of $V$ to $P$, represented by


\begin{equation}\label{1}
    \left(
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    vp_{11} & \ldots & vp_{1M} \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    vp_{N1} & \ldots & vp_{NM} \\
  \end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}\\
where\\
\begin{equation}\label{2}
    vp_{ij}=\Bigg\lbrace \begin{array}{cl}    
     1, & if\, v_i\, is\, assigned\,to\, p_j \\ 
    0, & otherwise \\
    \end{array} \\
    1\leq i\leq N \, , \, 1\leq j\leq M     
\end{equation}



 For a given assignment $VP$, the $CPU$ utilization of $p_j$ can be calculated by\\
 \begin{equation}\label{3}
 u_j=\frac{
\sum_{i=1}^Nv_{cpu}^i*vp_{ij}
 }{p_{cpu}^j} \\
\end{equation}\\

 The energy consumption of $p_j$ can be computed by\\

\begin{equation}\label{4}
    e_j=\Bigg\lbrace \begin{array}{ll}    
     0,& when \, \sum_{i=1}^Nvp_{ij}=0  \\
(e_{max}^j-e_{idle}^j)*\frac{u_j}{100}+e_{idle}^j,& otherwise\\
    \end{array} \\   
\end{equation}


 When $\sum_{i=1}^Nvp_{ij} =0$, it means that no virtual machine is assigned to
 $p_j$, so it can be turned off and cost no energy. This
 linear power model is summarized and formulated in \cite{beloglazov10}.
 \\

 The objective of the research is to find an assignment $VP$ that minimizes: \\
\begin{equation}\label{5}
\sum_{j=1}^Me_j  \\
\end{equation}

Subject to: \\
\begin{equation}\label{6}
\forall i,\sum_{j=1}^Mvp_{ij}=1  \\
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{7}
\forall j \sum_{i=1}^Nv_{mem}^i*vp_{ij}\leq p_{mem}^j \\
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{8}
\forall j \sum_{i=1}^Nv_{cpu}^i*vp_{ij}\leq p_{cpu}^j \\
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{9}
\forall j \sum_{i=1}^Nv_{net}^i*vp_{ij}\leq p_{net}^j \\
\end{equation}
Constraint (6) means one virtual machine can only be assigned to physical
machine; constraints (7,8,9) requires that the total assigned CPU, RAM, or
network resources cannot exceed the respective capacity on one host. Here we
implicitly assume that the overall resources on the Physical Machines (PMs) are
enough to accommodate the guest virtual machines, so we can ensure every guest
Virtual Machine (VM) can have a host to run on.

If we traverse all the combinations of VMs with PMs, there complexity is at
least $N^M$, so there will be no exact solution to the problem when $N$ and $M$
become a little larger. Therefore, we are going to deal with this problem via a
heuristic way.


\section{Algorithm description}

As the authors of SA suggests, there are basically four components in the
algorithm: 1) configuration of the system; 2) a generator of the new
configuration; 3) the objective function for the optimization problem; 4) a
schedule of the temperatures and length of times to evolve
\cite{kirkpatrick83}.In SAVMP, the four components are clearly defined to follow this methodology.

\subsection{Configuration of the problem}
The assignment of virtual machines $V$ to physical machines $P$ is the
configuration. Making use of constraint that one VM can only assigned to one PM,
and for the convenience of implementation of the algorithm, we use an integer
array to represent the assignment rather than the matrix as in Equation (1). \\
\begin{equation}\label{10}
VM=\{vm_1,vm_2,\ldots,vm_i,\ldots,vm_{n}\} \\
\end{equation}\\
The index of the array is the VM number, and the value indexed by the VM number
in the array is the PM number to which the VM is assigned. For example, we have
10 VMs indexed from 1 to 10 and 3 PMs numbered from 1 to 3.
$VM=\{1,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,1,2\}$ means that $vm_1,vm_3,vm_6 \, $and$ \, vm_9$ are
assigned to $pm_1$; $vm_5,vm_8 \,$ and $\, vm_{10}$ are assigned to $pm_2$;$vm_4
\, and \, vm_7$ are assigned to $pm_3$.

\subsection{Generator of new configurations }
The aim of the algorithm is to search better configurations in term of objective
function, but the search space is very large. Which way is the economical path
toward better solutions? SA recommends searching in the neighbourhood states for
better results. At every evolution step, the configuration needs to be changed
into a neighborhood state, so the configurations change slowly moving toward
better configurations. We define a new neighborhood state as the new VM
assignment array changed by picking a small random number (from 1 to 3 in this
implementation) of VMs and changing their host machines to randomly selected PMs
or swapping a pair of VM assignment.
These two types of rearrangement of VMs to create new configurations reflect the
basic operations of doing bin-packing to get a better result.

\subsection{ Acceptance criteria of new configurations}
While generating new configurations provides the candidate solutions, the
acceptance criteria decide which solutions are favoured. In the proposed
algorithm, if a new configuration is feasible, namely satisfying all constraints
specified by Equation (6,7,8,9), and has lower energy consumption than the
previous state, it will be accepted as the new state.
The energy cost expressed in Equation (5) is computed for each state. To be
simple, during the energy computation, if a solution is found to be infeasible,
the ernergy value will be assigned a huge number, which will not pass the
acceptance criteria. Therefore the energy comparison is the only factor in the
acceptance decision. When the neighborhood searching gets into a stalemate, we
allow the new state to cost more energy than the previous one by a certain
amount, called $deivationEngergy$ in our algorithm, so the algorithm would not
be stuck in a local optimization.
The $deivationEngergy$ is decided by the temperature. We define it as $e_l$:\\
\begin{equation}\label{11}
e_l=Max(e_{max}^j)*\frac{t_c}{t_0} \\
\end{equation}\\
Where $t_c$ is the current temperature and $t_0$ is the initial temperature.
Hence at a high temperature, the energy increase by the next state can be large,
but when the temperature is low, the energy of accepted states will become
stable.

\subsection{ Temperature Scheduling}
Temperature controlling is a very important aspect in annealing( metal
processing), so it is in the simulation annealing methodology. It determines how
the searching are arranged. How many iterations are allowed at each temperature
and the range of temperature, for example, is part of temperature scheduling.
However, adusting the scheduling of the temperature is not detailed in the SA
methodolody, but explained through an emprical way. We tried several settings
and selected the best parameters of the scheduling as follows. The temperature starts from 1000 degree and reduces
gradually to 0 by 5 degrees each time, at which new temperature there are $10,000*N$ times
of evolutions.

\subsection{SAVMP alogrithm pseudocode and complexity analysis }

The main steps of Simulated Annealing VM placement algorithm are quite
straightforward as described in the pseudocode program below. As the energy
calculation needs $C*M$ times of computaiton, where $C$ is a const, the
complexity is $1,000*10,000*N*C*M$, which can be expressed as $O(N*M)$.

\end{algorithm}


\section{Experiment and Evaluation}

To test the performance of SAVMP, we design the tests with different numbers of
VMs and PMs. In the tests, for the same number of VMs, PM sizes are varied with
capacity changed accordingly. Specifically, VM numbers are 20, 50, 100 or 200.
To show the size of containers, we introduce Capacity Index:\\
\begin{equation}\label{12}
CI=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^Mp_{cpu}^j / M}{\sum_{i=1}^Nv_{cpu}^i / N} \\
\end{equation} 
If $CI$ is 1, that means the number of PMs in the problem is the same as the
number of VMs, and $CI=5$ means the PM number is only one fifth of that of VMs. In the
following experiment, for every number of VM, CI values are multiple, trying
each in the set$ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]$.
The VM CPU requirement is generated randomly from the value 0 to 2000. This is
to simulate the resource usage of the VMs at the data center at a sampling time.
The PM sizes vary from 1000 to 3000 multiplied by the CI (capacity index),
simulating the heterogeneous host environment.

In one group of tests, we only consider CPU requirements and in another we add
memory requirements to test the performance of the SAVMP on one dimensional and
two dimensional packing respectively. The requirement of memory is generated in
the same way as CPU, but the two requirements are most probably not the same
value for the same VM because of the random nature.
Each PM's maximum energy $e_j$ is given by the equation:\\
\begin{equation}\label{13}
e_j=(1-\log (p_{cpu}^j/1000)*0.4)*E*(p_{cpu}^j/1000) \\
\end{equation} 
Where E is a const, set to 100 Watt in our test, representing the base energy
which is consumed by the smallest PM when $p_{cpu}^j=1000$. When the CPU
capability is 10 times of the smallest PM, the energy cost is only 6 times as
much. This equation reflects the energy saving method by adopting larger
physical machines.

For each physical server, the energy of idle sqtatus is set to 70\% of the
 maximum power, namely,\\
 \begin{equation}\label{14}
e_{idle}^j= e_{max}^j*0.7
\end{equation} 

As to the initial placement, our proposed SAVMP does not require a specified
state. In the following tests, we choose to start from the placement results
generated by FFD, although SAVMP can achieve a comparable result from a random
feasible placement with the cost of more time according to our preliminary
tests.

For every configuration of VMs and PMs, we run ten times and average the energy
saving compared to FFD and the time to reach the best placement among all the
evolutions in order to have a statistical view of performance of the SAVMP
because it does not generate the exact same result every time as FFD does for
the same problem. All the tests are run on a laptop with a 2.2G Hz dual core
processor.

As the best possible solution is not avaible to be compared with, we calculate
the low boundary of energy consumption to see how far the SAVMP result is from
the low boundary (LB). The LB is calculated by the way described in Algorithm 2,
which fills the most energy efficient PMs first, and otherwise finds a PM with
the lowest energy cost to accommodate the left CPU requirement. This energy
value is the theoretically lowest one without considering the
constraints(7,8,9). If an alogrithm find a solution with the energy value very
close to low boundary, we can say it is a very good result. However, it cannot
be concluded that an algorithm performs badly when its energy value is far from
the LB, because the constraints may be the reason for the poor energy
efficiency.

Table 1 lists the testing results of FFD, SAVMP and the low boundary energy on
24 problems with different VM and PM numbers. Each problem has one row in the
table.  In the columns, `VM No', `PM No' show how many VMs and PMs are
in the problems respectively; CI is the capacity index, which is explained
before; `Energy by FFD' is the energy cost if the VMs' assignment to PMs  is
decided by the FFD algorithm; `Energy by SA', in which SA is the short format
for SAVPM for saving space, is energy cost of the placement by SAVPM; `Energy
Saved' is calculated by 1 - `Energy by SA'/`Energy by FFD'; `SA from LB'
represents how many more percentage of energy used by SAVMP than FFD; `Time' is
the time cost for SAVPM to find the `best' solution.
In this group of tests, only the CPU constraints and the one VM assigned to one PM
assignment constraints(Eq 6) are considered.

From Table1, we can see SAVMP is able to generate better results than FFD for
most of the situations and at least no worse results than FFD for all the tests.
This may partially attribute to starting from the FFD placement, but this also
shows one of its good characteristics of starting from any feasible placement
and improving it little by little.

However, the improvement by SAVMP varies with the VM numbers and CI. The larger
is the VM number or CI, the less is the improvement. This can be attributed to 2
possible reasons. One is that with the larger number of VMs and PMs, the search
space becomes larger; another one is that the performance of FFD varies on the
different problems. In Table-2, the placement results reveal that FFD can have a
very good result when VM number is 200 and CI is 10. `PM' column in Table 2 is
the PM index number, represent one PM in the problem; `Size' is the CPU
capacity; `CPU' is CPU utilization rate when a certain number of VMs are
assigned to the PM. Some PMs are not assigned any VMs so the CPU usage is
0.00\%.

The energy saving improvement by SAVMP above FFD is not very significant, with
only averagely about 5\% better than the latter, because for the CPU only
constraint problem, FFD can generate a very good result, which can be seen by
comparing the energy of FFD and that of LB. 

Almost all the tests can achieve the best results among all the iterations in
less than 100 seconds. For the tests with exceptionally long time to reach the
``best'' results, we find that they can achieve very good results close to
the ``best'' result within 100 seconds after looking into the evolution
history records.

While the improvement by SAVMP for the one dimesion packing problem is not very
impressive, the results on the 2 dimension packing show the SAVMP performs
significantly better than FFD. In Table-3, which contains the results by FFD and
SAVMP with CPU and memory constraints, the columns are the same as in Table-1
except that there is an extra ``Energy saved by Random Search'' column in
Table-3, which lists the energy saving effects achieved by a random search
method. This method picks a PM randomly for each VM. If the chosen PM does not
satisfy the constraints, it will try another randomly chosen PM until it finds a
suitable one or give up searching and return no feasible solution after the
maximum attempts have been used. The same process repeats until all the VMs have
their assigned PMs.

The Random Search performs comparably to SAVMP when there are only 20 VMs.
However, when the VM number increases, the energy saving improvement becomes
worse. This is especially obvious when the number is greater than 50. The Random
Search can only improve by a small percentage to FFD when CI is 5 or 10. In all
tests but one test of which the VM number is 20 and CI is 5, the Random Search
performs worse than SAVMP.

We add the random methodology to prove that the SAVMP performs better than FFD
not only because it involves random searching method to explore more assignment
combinations than FFD, but also because the Simulation Annealing approach
provides a guided search more than random attempts.

The distances of SAVMP from the Low Boundary are averagely within 10 percentage,
which says the simulated annealing algorithm has achieved very good energy
saving results.

The improvement effect by SAVMP for two constraints is more significant than
that for only CPU constraint. When the VM number becomes larger, the improvement
tends to be less because the searching space grows bigger. The relationship of
the improvement and CI is not straightforward. It has two contradictory effects
on the improvement by SAVMP. For one thing, the larger the CI is, the smaller
the searching space becomes. The smaller searching space favors SAVMP but FFD
also performs better than when CI is smaller.

From the table, we can find another benefit of using SAVMP in the test of which
the VM number is 20 and CI is 10. FFD or Random Search cannot find a feasible
solution for this test, but SAVMP can find the assignment successfully.

It is very hard to determine the minimum energy usage among all the possible
assignment, but we can use the resource utilization on the PMs resulted from the
VM assignment to examine and compare the energy saving effect by different
algorithms. In Table-4, the utilization of CPU and memory has been
listed for each PM for the test of 200 VMs with CI set to 10 applying FFD and
SAVMP respectively. It is clear from the table that SAVMP achieve higher
resource utilization with 2 less PMs turned on than FFD, leaving very small
room for to be improved if there is any.

\section{Conclusion and Future work}

We propose a VM placement algorithm based on Simulated Annealing methodology to
improve energy efficiency in data centers. The First Fit Decreasing algorithm
for bin-packing and random search strategy are selected for comparison in
evaluating the performance of the algorithm. Extensive experiment has been done
with different problem configurations. The number of VMs varies from 20 to 200,
the sizes of the PMs are from one to 10 times of maximum requirement of VMs, and
resource constraints are CPU only - one dimensional, and CPU combined with
memory - two dimensions.

Experiment results show that it can generate better VM assignment than FFD,
especially in the two dimensional constraint problems with 0-25\% more energy
saving than FFD in a reasonable time limit. How much improvement it can make
from the FFD depends on a number of factors: the larger the problem size, the
less the improvement; the better is FFD fit for the target problem, the less the
improvement; two dimensional problems leave more room for improvement.

It can also be concluded from the comparison beween SAVMP and Random
Search that SAVMP is more efficient search strategy guided by target objective
than random searching. SAVPM can improve energy saving in all the tests, while
Random Search can only do so in small-scale problems and to less signifcantly
over all.

Besides the more effective optimization result, the SAVMP has another benefit:
it generates multiple placements that have better optimization result than FFD.
This makes the algorithm potential to be used in the dynamic VM allocation to
minimize the migration cost while saving energy. In our future work we will
attempt using SAVMP in live VM migration solution and compare its effectiveness
with existing solutions.
